# Getting Started

Welcome to the **Accumulate Python Client**!  
Follow these steps to **quickly install and start using** the client for interacting with the [Accumulate Protocol](https://accumulatenetwork.io/).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- *(Optional)* **git** (for cloning the repo)
- *(Optional but recommended)* **virtualenv** (for isolated environments)

---

### Option 1: Install via PyPI (Recommended for most users)

Install the library directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install accumulate-python-client
```

---

### Option 2: Install from Source (For development or latest updates)

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendlt/accumulate-python-client.git
cd accumulate-python-client
```

#### 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
