![Accumulate](./accumulate_logo.png)

The **Accumulate Python Client** is a robust library designed for developers to interact seamlessly with the [Accumulate Protocol](https://accumulatenetwork.io/). This library simplifies working with accounts, transactions, signatures, querying blockchain data, and more within the Accumulate blockchain ecosystem.

---

## Key Features

- **Account Management**: Effortlessly manage token accounts, lite accounts, and keybooks.
- **Transaction Handling**: Construct, sign, and submit blockchain transactions with ease.
- **Event and Data Querying**: Fetch and process data from the Accumulate blockchain.
- **Cryptographic Utilities**: Tools for signing, verifying, and working with keys and addresses.
- **Blockchain Utilities**: Support for URL parsing, data encoding, and validation.

## Installation

Install the library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install accumulate-python-client
```
